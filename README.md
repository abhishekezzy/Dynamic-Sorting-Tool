# Dynamic-Sorting-Tool
Suggests the Sorting Algorithm to use on the basis of the data distribution and execution time. 

Execute the Random File Generator.py to generate an raw_data.txt file of unsorted data. The path of the file is "C:\Users\Abhishek\Desktop\raw_data.txt". 

import the sort.h header file to use the various sorting algorithms by calling them in your code. Function parameters for calling can be induced from the header file itself. Generic Programming is used to allow sorting of data irrespective of its data types. For eg. you can sort characters, float, double, int, long long etc data types.

The Dynamic Sorting Tool will individually execute all the sorting algorithms implemented and calculate the execution time of all the sorting algorithms. It will suggest which sorting algorithm to use to sort the data on the basis of data distribution in the raw_data.txt and sort the data on the basis of the algorithm taking minimum execution time. The path of the sorted_data.txt file is "C:\Users\Abhishek\Desktop\sorted_data.txt".

Fork the tool to use it and fixing bugs and adding more functionalities is appreciated.
